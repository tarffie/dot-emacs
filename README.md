## Welcome to My Unholy GNU Emacs config!
Hello, there üëã This is my homemade **emacs** config, made by me only, having in mind extensibility and that I *really* like vanilla Emacs looks and feels, specially the vanilla bindings. 

### About the project 
**Emacs** is an extensible and self-hackable Development environment, my original idea wasn't far from that, I wanted a lightweight, non *'frameworkal'* config, keeping the original bindings and when adding new ones, making sure they worked as the other gnu key-bindings would. 
Currently the project supports most major programming languages but some tweaks might be necessary.  


## Features and to-do work 

SmartyPants converts ASCII punctuation characters into "smart" typographic punctuation HTML entities. For example:

|                | 		      implemented                     | need configuration                             |
